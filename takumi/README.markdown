# Takumi

Takumi is a back end for gizmo.gg. It is a JavaScript alternative to Paladin,
which is written in Haskell. It is still a work in progress, so don't expect it
to do everything that Paladin does yet.

1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2.  Run tests with `npm test`.
3.  Start server with `npm start`.
