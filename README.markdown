# [gizmo.gg][]

gizmo.gg is split into a few services:

- [Venom](./venom): The top-level HTTP server.
- [Merc](./merc): The front end.
- [Paladin](./paladin): The back end.

Check out the [ops](./ops) directory for how those services are managed.

There is a separate desktop app. It's called [gizmo-gg-uploader][].
